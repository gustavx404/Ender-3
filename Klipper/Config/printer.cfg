# This file contains common pin mappings for the BIGTREETECH SKR mini
# E3 v2.0. To use this config, the firmware should be compiled for the
# STM32F103 with a "28KiB bootloader" and USB communication. Also,
# select "Enable extra low-level configuration options" and configure
# "GPIO pins to set at micro-controller startup" to "!PA14".

# The "make flash" command does not work on the SKR mini E3. Instead,
# after running "make", copy the generated "out/klipper.bin" file to a
# file named "firmware.bin" on an SD card and then restart the SKR
# mini E3 with that SD card.

# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.

[endstop_phase stepper_z]
#endstop_accuracy:
#   Sets the expected accuracy (in mm) of the endstop. This represents
#   the maximum error distance the endstop may trigger (eg, if an
#   endstop may occasionally trigger 100um early or up to 100um late
#   then set this to 0.200 for 200um). The default is
#   4*rotation_distance/full_steps_per_rotation.
trigger_phase: 35/64
#   This specifies the phase of the stepper motor driver to expect
#   when hitting the endstop. It is composed of two numbers separated
#   by a forward slash character - the phase and the total number of
#   phases (eg, "7/64"). Only set this value if one is sure the
#   stepper motor driver is reset every time the mcu is reset. If this
#   is not set, then the stepper phase will be detected on the first
#   home and that phase will be used on all subsequent homes.
#endstop_align_zero: False
#   If true then the position_endstop of the axis will effectively be
#   modified so that the zero position for the axis occurs at a full
#   step on the stepper motor. (If used on the Z axis and the print
#   layer height is a multiple of a full step distance then every
#   layer will occur on a full step.) The default is False.
